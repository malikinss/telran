A TypeScript Node.js application that extracts code and comments from a source file into separate files. Uses asynchronous file reading, line-by-line parsing, and supports unit testing with Jest.

## [Homework 3: Logger functionality](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw3)

A TypeScript Logger with configurable log levels, timestamped messages, and colored console output. Supports level-specific and global handlers, leveraging Node.js EventEmitter for flexible logging and extensibility.

## [Homework 4: RandomNumbersStream Application](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw4)

A TypeScript Node.js application providing a readable stream of random numbers. Supports unique or non-unique numbers, configurable ranges and amounts, streaming output, and centralized configuration with proper error handling.

## [Homework 5: Random Unique Numbers using Async Pipeline](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw5)

A TypeScript Node.js project that generates random unique numbers using an asynchronous stream pipeline. Features modular streams for generation, uniqueness enforcement, formatting, and console output, with configuration-driven parameters and robust validation.

## [Homework 6: Calculator on HTTP Server](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw6)

A TypeScript Node.js HTTP server that performs basic arithmetic operations via JSON requests. Validates input, executes calculations, handles errors with appropriate HTTP status codes, and follows a modular design separating controller, service, and utility modules.

## [Homework 7: Express Middleware and Routes](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw7)

A TypeScript Express server demonstrating custom middleware, request rate limiting, and modular routes. Features include timestamping requests, limiting repeated requests, and structured JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes.

## [Homework 8: Employees Back-End](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw8)

A TypeScript Express backend for managing employees with full CRUD functionality. Features include in-memory data storage, modular routes and controllers, middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and error handling, and integration-ready endpoints for a React front-end.

## [Homework 9: Validation & Persistence](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw9)

A TypeScript + Express backend for managing employees with full data validation using Zod and persistent storage in a JSON file. Features include CRUD operations, graceful shutdown with auto-save, error-handling middleware, and fully typed endpoints.

## [Homework 10: Employees Back-End with Role-Based Authentication](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw10)

A TypeScript + Express backend for managing employees with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. Features include CRUD operations, Zod validation, in-memory storage with JSON persistence, and secure endpoints for ADMIN and USER roles.

## [Homework 11: Controller Unit Tests and Route Integration Testing](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw11)

TypeScript + Express backend for employee management with comprehensive controller unit tests and route integration tests. Features `JWT` authentication, role-based access, Zod validation, in-memory + file persistence, and automated testing using Supertest and Node’s native test runner. Ensures all endpoints are fully validated and secure.

## [Homework 12: Service Unit-Test](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw12)

TypeScript unit tests for the `EmployeesService` module. Covers all service methods (`getAll`, `getEmployee`, `addEmployee`, `updateEmployee`, `deleteEmployee`) with success and error cases. Uses Node’s built-in test runner to ensure isolated, reliable business logic without involving Express routes.

## [Homework 13: SQL Service Implementation with AbstractEmployeesServiceSql](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw13)

TypeScript SQL-backed employee service implementing `AbstractEmployeesServiceSql` with full CRUD using Knex and SQLite. Ensures persistent storage, testable service methods, and integration with the service registry. All methods are covered by unit tests.

## [Homework 14: Mongo Service Implementation with AbstractEmployeesServiceMongo](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw14)

TypeScript MongoDB-backed employee service implementing `AbstractEmployeesServiceMongo`. Provides full CRUD with in-memory Mongo simulation, Zod validation, and role-based access. All service tests pass, ensuring reliable, modular persistence compatible with multiple storage backends.

## [Homework 15: SQL Queries on Chinook Database](https://github.com/malikinss/telran-backend-hw15)

SQL queries on the `Chinook` database exploring tracks, albums, artists, invoices, customers, playlists, and employees. Focuses on multi-table JOINs, sorting, date formatting, and extracting meaningful relationships. Strengthens practical SQL skills for backend and data-driven applications.
